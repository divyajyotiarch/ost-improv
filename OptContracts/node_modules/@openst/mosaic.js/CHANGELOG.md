## Version 0.10.0 ⚓️ Anchor

<!-- [**Release 0.10.0, (<date-here>)**](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic.js/releases/tag/0.10.0) -->

You can use mosaic.js to interact with contracts on mosaic chains.

It requires [mosaic-contracts](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic-contracts) for ABIs and BINs of contracts.

### Notable Changes

* Library is provided via npm package [@openstfoundation/mosaic.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openstfoundation/mosaic.js)

* Now provides a `Facilitator` class for easier interaction ([#42](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic.js/pull/42), [#51](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic.js/pull/51), [#56](https://github.com/OpenSTFoundation/mosaic.js/pull/56)).
